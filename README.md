## IntelliJ

I chose IntelliJ as my IDE. Open the folder named "project" in IntelliJ. You can open the module setting by right clicking on the folder name and click on "Open Module Settings", or just by simply pressing F4. \
Set the Project SDK in the project settings. I used Java version 13, but you can choose any version.\
To get JDBC working, navigate to the Modules bar and click on the "+" button on the right side and choose "JARs or directories...", and navigate to the .jar file I've attached. 

## ER and Schema

Both the ER and the Schema diagrams are located in the diagram folder.

## DDL

The DDL folder contains all the sql statements needed for initialization.\
DDL.sql is to initialize the tables.\ 
DDLInsertion.sql is to insert the dummy values. \
deleteTables.sql is to drop all the tables. This sql statement is provided in case of need.
